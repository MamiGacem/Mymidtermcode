Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. Programing language is a computer language for coding and building software.

What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A.JDK stands for Java development Kit, it contains-
# Java runtime environment (JRE)
( JRE takes Java code, combines it with necessary libraries and start the JVM to execute it. )
* Java Virtual Machine ( JVM )
( JVM verifies and executes java bytecode. First compiler compiles the code and generate bytecode
and then inter convert the bytecode to machine understandable code. )
* The Just-In_Time ( JIT )
( Its a component that compile bytecodes to native codes at Run Time )
* Core Libraries
( The core libraries consists of classes which are used by many properties of the JDK. )
# Compiler
( Compiler convert source code to byte code )
# Debugger
( Debugger allows user to halt the program and examine the value of variable in the execution line by line. )
# Disassembler
( Java Disassembler disassemble the Java bytecode after compiled.
And then information about the Member Variable and Methods are printed. )

What is IDE?
A. IDE stands for Integrated Development Environment. It is a software allows user to
   write, execute and debug Java program.

What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Eclipse, IntelliJ, Netbeans.

Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. At Editing Time-----
   * we write the program and save it .java file.
   At compile time----
   * Compiler convert source code (.java) to .class file which is byte code.
   Also known as machine independent or platform independent code
   At Runtime-------
   * JIT compile the bytecode to native code which will execute by CPU

what is class?
A. A class is a blueprint for an object.

What is object?
A. Instance of a class.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. The main method.

Why main is static?
A. So JVM can invoke it without instantiating the class. JVM looks for this method signature to execute the Java program.

    Which class is the superclass of all classes?
is Object class

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
PATH is an environment variable that is used to find and locate binary files like “java” and “javac” and to locate needed
executables from the command line or Terminal window. To set the path, we’re supposed to include or mention JDK_HOME/bin
 directory in a PATH environment variable. The PATH can not be overridden by providing command and PATH is only used by
the operation system(OS) to find binary files.
The ClassPath is a parameter in the Java Virtual Machine(JVM) or the Java compiler that is used by a system or application
ClassLoader to locate and load compiled Java bytecodes stored in the “.class” file. On the other hand, The Path is also an
environment variable path that behaves as a mediator between the operating system and developer to inform binary file path.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
the nmain difference between an interface and an abstract class is that an interface cannot have state,whereas the abstract
class can have state with instance variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. Extend Abstract Class or implement Interface to a new Class and then the new class can be instantiated.

what is Access Specifier?
Access modifiers are a specific part of programming language syntax used to facilitate the encapsulation of components

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
OOP is a care of java programming which is used for designing a program using classes and objects, the main principales of
 Oop is : abstraction (data hiding which displays only the information needed and hides the unneccessary one ),encapsulation
 (data is hidden from other classes and can be accessed only throught the current  class's methods),inheritance(represents the
 parent-child relationship),polymorphism (occurs when we have many classes related to each other by inheritance and we have
 the overriding and overloading polymorphism).

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
a java package is a namespace that organize a set of related classes and interfaces , in java two pckages:
java.lang package and a no-name package (default package) are imported by default in all java classes.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
an API is the area of java development kit (JDK) , we used classes,interfaces,packages and also their methods,fields and constructors.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
the Java programming language supports multiple inheritance of type, which is the ability of
a class to implement more than one interface. An object can have multiple types: the type of
its own class and the types of all the interfaces that the class implements.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
it is a feature that allows a class to have more than one method with the same name but with different parameters, it happen in the compile time.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
exception is when a file system error being encountered when trying to read or write a file or a program attemting to divide by zero,  to handle it
we have to put the code inside the try bloc.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
In the Java programming language, the keyword static means that the particular member belongs to a type itself, rather than to an instance of that type.
 This means we'll create only one instance of that static member that's shared across all instances of the class.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for classes, attributes and methods, which makes them non-changeable
(impossible to inherit or override). The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to always store the same value,
like PI (3.14159...). The final keyword is called a "modifier".

What is final, finally and finalize?
final is a keyword used in Java to restrict the modification of a variable, method, or class. finally is a block
used in Java to ensure that a sectionof code is always executed, even if an exception is thrown. finalize is a method
in Java used to perform cleanup processing on an object before it is garbage collected.

What is a constructor ?
A. Special type of method that is used to initialize the state of an object in a class.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. Default Constructor.

What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. Refers to the current object in a method or constructor.

What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects. It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the superclass constructor.
The most common use of the super keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses and subclasses that have methods with the same name.

What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine.

Is JVM platform independent?
A. Yes.

What version of java are you using?8.0

What is JAR stand for ?
Java ARchive.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. JDK is for development purposes and JVM is responsible for converting the byte code to the machine-specific code.

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE is for running the java programs. JVM provides platform independence.

What is compile time and run time?
Compile time is the period when the programming code (such as C#, Java, C, Python) is converted to
 the machine code (i.e. binary code). Runtime is the period of time when a program is running and generally occurs after compile time.

What is heap?
A. Runtime data area in which the memory is allocated to the objects.

How java manage it's memory?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or decrease in size while the application runs.
When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer is thread-safe and synchronized
whereas StringBuilder is not. That's why StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer

What is Singleton class?
A. Object hiding.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
serialization means converting an object into a sequence of bytes,deserialization is exactly the opposite.

when to use transient variable in java?
Transient in Java is used to mark the member variable not to be serialized when it is persisted to streams of bytes. This keyword plays an important role to meet
security constraints in Java. It ignores the original value of a variable and saves the default value of that variable data type

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. While Loop tests the condition before executing code block and in a do/while loop; the body is executed once before the condition is checked.

What is Enum?
A. A type who's fields consist of a fixed set of constants.


What is Iterator?
Iterator in Java is an object used to cycle through arguments or elements present in a collection. It is derived from the technical term “iterating,”
which means looping through. Generally, an iterator in Java is used to loop through any collection of objects.

Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
As already mentioned int is a primitive data type and takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store.
On other hand Integer is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its int value.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
because of the security,synchronization and concurrency,caching,and class loading.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
is the process of calling a sequence of constructors.we ccan do it in two ways:by using this()keyword for chaining constructors in the
same class.by using super() keyword for chaining constructors from the parent class.

The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
The primary difference between the serial and parallel collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.
The parallel collector is intended for applications with medium-sized to large-sized data sets that are run on multiprocessor or multithreaded hardware.

What is JIT stands for?
just in time.

Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap is created when the JVM starts up and may increase
or decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap becomes full, garbage is collected. During the
garbage collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus making space for new objects.

Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
No, Garbage collection does not guarantee that a program will not run out of memory

What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
ava Heap Space is used throughout the application, but Stack is only used for the method — or methods — currently running.
The Heap Space contains all objects are created, but Stack contains any reference to those objects. Objects stored in the Heap can be accessed throughout the applicatio

What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language. It allows an executing Java program to examine or "introspect" upon itself,
and manipulate internal properties of the program. For example, it's possible for a Java class to obtain the names of all its members and display them.

what is multithreading in java?
Multithreading is a programming concept in which the application can create a small unit of tasks to execute in parallel. If you are working on a computer,
 it runs multiple applications and allocates processing power to them. A simple program runs in sequence and the code statements execute one by one.

What is the use of synchronization in Java?
Synchronization in java is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to any shared resource. In the Multithreading concept, multiple threads try
to access the shared resources at a time to produce inconsistent results. The synchronization is necessary for reliable communication between threads

What is Framework?
A. Software libraries created to make building applications easier and faster. Consists of pre-written code that you can use to help develop your own code.

What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. JUnit, TestNG, Selenium, Jenkins.

Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. Both are unit testing frameworks, however for TestNG parallel testing is possible.

What are the dependencies for this project?
mysql-connector-java,mongo-java-driver,junit

what is dependency injection in java?
Dependency Injection in Java is a way to achieve Inversion of control (IoC) in our application by moving objects binding from compile time to runtime.
We can achieve IoC through Factory Pattern, Template Method Design Pattern, Strategy Pattern and Service Locator pattern too.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Static binding is resolved at compile time (Method Overloading). Dynamic binding is resolved at run time (Method Overriding).
